    "# Scrollbar [1](https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm)\n",
    "Unlike in some toolkits, scrollbars are not a part of another widget (e.g. a listbox), but are a separate widget altogether. Instead, scrollbars communicate with the scrolled widget by calling methods on the scrolled widget; as it turns out, the scrolled widget also needs to call methods on the scrollbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every widget that can be scrolled vertically includes a method named `yview` (those that can be scrolled horizontally have a method named `xview`). As long as this method is present, the scrollbar doesn't need to know anything else about the scrolled widget. When the scrollbar is manipulated, it will tack on some number of parameters to the method call, indicating how it was scrolled, to what position, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scrolled widget also needs to communicate back to the scrollbar, telling it what percentage of the entire content area is now visible. Besides the `yview` and/or `xview` methods, every scrollable widget also has a `yscrollcommand` and/or `xscrollcommand` configuration option. This is used to specify a method call, which must be the scrollbar's `set` method. Again, additional parameters will be automatically tacked onto the method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for some reason you want to move the scrollbar to a particular position from within your program, you can call the `set first last` method yourself. Pass it two values between 0 and 1 indicating the start and end percentage of the content area that is visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Option | Description |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| activebackground | The background color of the widget when it has the focus. |\n",
    "| bg | The background color of the widget. |\n",
    "| bd | The border width of the widget. |\n",
    "| command | It can be set to the procedure associated with the list which can be called each time when the scrollbar is moved. |\n",
    "| cursor | The mouse pointer is changed to the cursor type set to this option which can be an arrow, dot, etc. |\n",
    "| elementborderwidth | It represents the border width around the arrow heads and slider. The default value is -1. |\n",
    "| Highlightbackground | The focus highlighcolor when the widget doesn't have the focus. |\n",
    "| highlighcolor | The focus highlighcolor when the widget has the focus. |\n",
    "| highlightthickness | It represents the thickness of the focus highlight. |\n",
    "| jump | It is used to control the behavior of the scroll jump. If it set to 1, then the callback is called when the user releases the mouse button. |\n",
    "| orient | It can be set to HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL depending upon the orientation of the scrollbar. |\n",
    "| repeatdelay | This option tells the duration up to which the button is to be pressed before the slider starts moving in that direction repeatedly. The default is 300 ms. |\n",
    "| repeatinterval | The default value of the repeat interval is 100. |\n",
    "| takefocus | We can tab the focus through this widget by default. We can set this option to 0 if we don't want this behavior. |\n",
    "| troughcolor | It represents the color of the trough. |\n",
    "| width | It represents the width of the scrollbar. |\n",

    "| get() | It returns the two numbers a and b which represents the current position of the scrollbar. |\n",
    "| set(first, last) | It is used to connect the scrollbar to the other widget w. The yscrollcommand or xscrollcommand of the other widget to this method. |"
