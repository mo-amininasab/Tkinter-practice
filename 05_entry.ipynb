    "| insertwidth | It represents the value indicating the total width of the insertion cursor. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to Tk_GetPixels. |\n",
    "| justify | It specifies how the text is organized if the text contains multiple lines. |\n",

    "| index(index) | It is used to place the cursor to the left of the character written at the specified index. |\n",
    "| insert(index,s) | It is used to insert the specified string before the character placed at the specified index. |\n",
