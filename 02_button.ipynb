    "## State\n",
    "All themed widgets carry with them an internal state, which is a series of binary flags. You can set or clear these different flags, as well as check the current setting using the \"state\" and \"instate\" methods. Buttons make use of the \"disabled\" flag to control whether or not the user can press the button. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Flag | Description |\n",
    "|-|-|\n",
    "| `button.state(['disabled'])` | Set the disabled flag, disabling the button |\n",
    "| `button.state(['!disabled'])` | Clear the disabled flag |\n",
    "| `button.instate(['disabled'])` | Return true if the button is disabled, else false |\n",
    "| `button.instate(['!disabled'])` | Return true if the button is not disabled, else false |\n",
    "| `button.instate(['!disabled'], cmd)` | Execute 'cmd' if the button is not disabled |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these commands accept an **array** of state flags as their argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using \"state\"/\"instate\" replaces the older \"state\" configuration option (which took the values \"normal\" or \"disabled\"). This configuration option is actually still available in Tk 8.5, but \"write-only\", which means that changing the option calls the appropriate \"state\" command,\n",
    "but other changes made using the \"state\" command are not reflected in the option. This is only for compatibility reasons; you should change your code to use the new state vector. ????????????????/\n",

    "\n",
    "Not all states are meaningful for all widgets. It's also possible to get fancy in the \"state\" and \"instate\" methods and specify multiple state flags at the same time. ???????????"
