    "Radiobuttons share most of the same configuration options as checkbuttons. One exception is that the `onvalue` and `offvalue` options are replaced with a single `value` option. Each of the radiobuttons of the set will have the same linked variable, but a different value; when the variable has the given value, the radiobutton will be selected, otherwise unselected. When the linked variable does not exist, radiobuttons also display a `tristate` or indeterminate, which can be checked via the `alternate` state flag."
