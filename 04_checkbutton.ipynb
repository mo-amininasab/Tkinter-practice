    "the `variable` option for checkbuttons behaves like `textvariable`, except it is used to read or change the current value of the widget, and updates whenever the widget is toggled.

    "What happens when the linked variable contains neither the on value or the off value (or even doesn't exist)? In that case, the checkbutton is put into a special \"tristate\" or indeterminate mode; you'll sometimes see this in user interfaces where the checkbox holds a single dash rather than being empty or holding a check mark. When in this state, the state flag `alternate` is set, so\n",
