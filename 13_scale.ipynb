    "| bd | The border size of the widget. The default is 2 pixel. |\n",

    "| cursor | The mouse pointer is changed to the cursor type assigned to this option. It can be an arrow, dot, etc. |\n",
    "| digits | If the control variable used to control the scale data is of string type, this option is used to specify the number of digits when the numeric scale is converted to a string. |\n",
    "| font | The font type of the widget text. |\n",
    "| fg | The foreground color of the text. |\n",
    "| from_ | It is used to represent one end of the widget range. |\n",
    "| highlightbackground | The highlight color when the widget doesn't have the focus. |\n",
    "| highlighcolor | The highlight color when the widget has the focus. |\n",
    "| label | This can be set to some text which can be shown as a label with the scale. It is shown in the top left corner if the scale is horizontal or the top right corner if the scale is vertical. |\n",
    "| length | It represents the length of the widget. It represents the X dimension if the scale is horizontal or y dimension if the scale is vertical. |\n",
    "| orient | It can be set to horizontal or vertical depending upon the type of the scale. |\n",
    "| relief | It represents the type of the border. The default is FLAT. |\n",
    "| repeatdelay | This option tells the duration up to which the button is to be pressed before the slider starts moving in that direction repeatedly. The default is 300 ms. |\n",
    "| resolution | It is set to the smallest change which is to be made to the scale value. |\n",
    "| showvalue | The value of the scale is shown in the text form by default. We can set this option to 0 to suppress the label. |\n",
    "| sliderlength | It represents the length of the slider window along the length of the scale. The default is 30 pixels. However, we can change it to the appropriate value. |\n",
    "| state | The scale widget is active by default. We can set this to DISABLED to make it unresponsive. |\n",
    "| takefocus | The focus cycles through the scale widgets by default. We can set this option to 0 if we don't want this to happen. |\n",
    "| tickinterval | The scale values are displayed on the multiple of the specified tick interval. The default value of the tickinterval is 0. |\n",
    "| to | It represents a float or integer value that specifies the other end of the range represented by the scale. |\n",
    "| troughcolor | It represents the color of the through. |\n",
    "| variable | It represents the control variable for the scale. |\n",
